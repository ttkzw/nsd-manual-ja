"A zone needs a SOA (Source Of Authority) record. For the exact structure "
"we refer you to `the wiki page "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOA_record>`_. Note that all records must "
"Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) which adds a ``.`` to the domain "
"name. In this example the FQDN is: ``example.com.``. This is in contrast "
"to relative domain names, where the origin gets appended (so in the "
"example below, ``www`` gets expanded to ``www.example.com.``)."

"Also note that ``@`` symbol in the zone file refers to the ``$ORIGIN`` "
"parameter. To have multi-line resource records opening and closing "
"brackets can be used to ignore linebreaks. Finally, if a name at the "
"start of a record is missed, the name from the previous entry gets used "
"(This is why all three A records are equivalent)."
